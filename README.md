# Minimum steps for using _git_
First make sure you have _git_ install on your machine.

## Get repository on machine:


```git clone https://Muraleetharanboopathi@bitbucket.org/fovcon/graphene-pressure-sensor.git```

[update] If you already have a local rpository and you made changes in cloud: 

```git pull```

## Pushing files to the cloud:

Before you _push_, always check _status_:

```git status```

If you added new files:

For all files to be added:
```git add . ```

only one specific file:
```git add <file_name> ```

Commit the changes:

```git commit -m "msg" ```

Now time to _push_:

```git push```
